## Command List

### Expand Selection

This command finds the next occurance of the selected text and adds it to the selections. This allows fast multi-selection refactoring of any text, not variable names.

This is the same feature as Sublime Text's `Selection > Expand Selection to Word` (cmd+D) command.
